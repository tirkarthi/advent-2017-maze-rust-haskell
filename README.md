Haskell compared with Rust

## Intro

Sam H. from Reddit [asked /r/haskell why](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7iumzb/haskell_mutable_collections_low_performance_vs/) his Haskell code, while not slow, was outperformed 10x faster by Rust. So I just took his Rust program and made a direct translation to Haskell.

## How to run

Rust

    $ cargo run -q --release
    reading file into bytestring took 922 us
    parsing 1058 lines took 23 us
    25608482, is the answer, it took 60 ms

Haskell

    $ stack build --verbosity silent && stack exec haskell
    reading file into bytestring took 209.75 us
    parsing 1058 lines took 47.76 us
    25608482, is the answer, it took 90.28 ms
    
D 

```
$ ldc -03 maze.d
$ ./maze
parsing file took 284 us
25608482 is the answer, it took 69 ms
```

(Both programs have been ran until they repeat a lower bound.)

## Haskell analysis

The Haskell code is a more or less direct translation of the Rust
code. Some comments:

Using ST to deal with the vector shaves off 10ms from the answer, but
this version is more direct.

You have to remember to annotate your integers, otherwise

``` haskell
while !(counter::Int) !(ind::Int) = do
```

without the annotations is inferred as an `Integer`, which is about **5x
slower. GHC warns about this.**

Using the `mapM (\(x, line) -> ...) (zip [0..] (S.lines ...))` pattern
is less efficient than the more direct `mapLinesM`.

I haven't tried compiling via LLVM. I'm unable to get the backend to
work on OS X. Someone else can try that.

Overall the programs run in the same order of magnitude in speed.

## Haskell runtime stats

           313,336 bytes allocated in the heap
                64 bytes copied during GC
           156,432 bytes maximum residency (1 sample(s))
            81,136 bytes maximum slop
                 5 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)

    Parallel GC work balance: nan% (serial 0%, perfect 100%)

    TASKS: 18 (1 bound, 17 peak workers (17 total), using -N8)

    SPARKS: 0 (0 converted, 0 overflowed, 0 dud, 0 GC'd, 0 fizzled)

    INIT    time    0.000s  (  0.002s elapsed)
